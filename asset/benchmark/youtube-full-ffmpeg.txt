[01:11.59 - 01:12.31] speaker_1: hi everyone
[01:12.87 - 01:28.15] speaker_0: so today we're going to talk about a cool topic reverse culture shock but first i want to introduce my sister because you probably don't know her so can you tell us first a little bit about where you've lived or country you lived in
[01:28.59 - 01:34.39] speaker_1: well i lived in france i lived in argentina and i recently returned from south korea cool
[01:34.67 - 01:37.19] speaker_0: cool so what were you doing in france
[01:37.83 - 01:55.51] speaker_1: in france i was in a pair in argentina i had multiple jobs actually i was oh first i worked as a volunteer organization then i taught english and then i every odd job and then i moved directly to south korea where i also taught english yeah
[01:55.79 - 02:01.11] speaker_0: so you're also an english teacher and where you used to be an english teacher and that's really cool yeah something in common yeah
[02:01.31 - 02:01.95] speaker_1: we do so
[02:02.71 - 02:13.47] speaker_0: the topic for today is reverse culture shock and maybe some people know about like what culture shock is but how would you describe reverse culture shock
[02:14.43 - 02:34.83] speaker_1: reverse culture shock is when you go from the country you've been living in a foreign country let's say south korea mh you come back to your home country and then all of a sudden everything feels foreign as if you were returning to a foreign country and not your home country you connect with people you feel very different
[02:35.55 - 02:45.99] speaker_0: everything around you from what used to be really normal for you exactly yeah and that's a terrible feeling because you feel like oh i should be going home i should be really comfortable and then you feel really weird
[02:46.79 - 02:55.99] speaker_1: exactly so you don't expect it you hear of culture shock but the reverse culture shock is something you're not expecting yeah because you don't prepare for it yeah that's too harder
[02:56.55 - 03:06.55] speaker_0: like maybe culture shock i don't know have you ever felt culture shock like regular culture shock when you moved to argentina or france or korea did you feel like i mean this is a new culture
[03:06.79 - 03:26.91] speaker_1: i definitely did to an extent huh it wasn't because you are preparing for it you know you're going to another country you are going to feel discomfort of some sort and you're expecting to feel it so i think you prepare more this culture shock but reverse culture shock you're not ready you're not prepared and it just hits
[03:26.95 - 03:50.19] speaker_0: you yeah especially when you go to another country and you know you're going to live there for a while you probably do a lot of preparation like i know when we moved to korea i was watching videos all the time about korea and what's life like some of the language like some culture different stuff mm but we only came back to the u s i didn't think about that at all it's just like oh it's just the u s it's my exact country right
[03:50.63 - 03:55.71] speaker_1: so it's it's definitely real it's definitely there and it's something that you don't think about
[03:55.83 - 04:02.79] speaker_0: so yeah especially when you've been living away for a while so how long were you living away from the u s before you came back
[04:03.55 - 04:04.43] speaker_1: four years so
[04:04.63 - 04:06.47] speaker_0: argentina so first argentina
[04:06.51 - 04:09.63] speaker_1: for a year then south korea for three years yeah that's
[04:09.75 - 04:11.23] speaker_0: a long time it has been a long time
[04:11.31 - 04:23.27] speaker_1: i hadn't made any trips just to visit friends or family so i and my friends weren't even american i would say so i wasn't even getting some culture from my american friend yeah your
[04:23.31 - 04:23.51] speaker_0: cult
[04:24.95 - 04:27.11] speaker_1: foreign or from the country i was living in
[04:27.71 - 04:33.59] speaker_0: yeah so when you lived in argentina and korea you didn't really have american friends so much just there were
[04:33.63 - 04:40.95] speaker_1: a few but they weren't the majority or i wasn't even like looking to make those connections with american yeah
[04:41.27 - 04:42.63] speaker_0: he wanted to make i wanted to
[04:42.79 - 04:45.47] speaker_1: be i make to the country and to the culture and
[04:45.91 - 05:06.95] speaker_0: yeah i think a lot of people at least like a lot of my students if they are living in an english speaking country that's like a huge question how can i meet people who are from the local culture but you did it like yeah what do you think helped you that's kind of off topic but what do you think helped you to make friends with people who weren't american was it like your job or you just hm learned the language
[05:07.71 - 05:29.99] speaker_1: i think what helped was going to events that weren't for foreigners going to those types of things where you know you're going to meet locals who live there and then just connecting with them and then a lot of times they're very receptive they want to be your friend too and then that kind of just brings you into their friend group
[05:30.19 - 05:34.23] speaker_0: yeah you mean like dances or concerts or what kind of events did you go to
[05:35.59 - 05:52.99] speaker_1: concerts a lot of a concerts in argentina mainly in south korea i would say it was with my work because i was the only foreigner at the school i worked at yeah so everyone i worked with was a local was korean and that's how i connected with them
[05:53.07 - 06:15.91] speaker_0: yeah so like if you wanted to learn more about the culture they were already around you mm that's really cool i think it takes a lot of guts though because when you are the only person who's american or from your country in an area maybe you'd be more likely to kind of seclude yourself or be like oh i feel really uncomfortable talking to them do they want to talk to me
[06:16.59 - 06:27.27] speaker_1: but they were very nice i i never felt that kind of awkward situation where maybe they don't want me here yeah i felt very welcomed in this is in south korea
[06:27.87 - 06:29.55] speaker_0: and in argentina was it different
[06:29.63 - 06:44.15] speaker_1: no it wasn't different i'm just coming this is coming from the experience of working in south korea a in argentina as well yeah but definitely in south korea because i was the only foreign teacher but luckily i was with my husband tt yeah so
[06:44.43 - 06:59.63] speaker_0: so can he tell us a little bit about tato because teresa's husband also plays an important role and i think this is like culture shock or acclimating to a new culture so can you tell us about him his name's tat so if you hear tat it's not an english word you don't know it's just his name
[07:00.03 - 07:38.27] speaker_1: sure he's colombian and we met in argentina yeah we got married in argentina and then together we moved to south korea so he's been with me through basically he's been everywhere in argentina in korea and then back to the u s right now and i think he's really helped me acclimate better just because i have somebody who's been with me through all these experiences and if no one else connects with me i know he will and i know he'll understand what i've been through because he's been through it too you can kind of hash it out together so that has helped a lot
[07:38.31 - 08:00.35] speaker_0: i think that makes a big difference too because i know when i've traveled alone somewhere and then i came back to the u s no one understood what i've seen or the cool experiences so i felt really lonely like there's no one i can talk to about this and if i said like oh i went here and i went there and this is really cool and oh and in germany it's like this they'd just be like oh that's really cool and maybe the sl but they can't be it right
[08:00.79 - 08:20.03] speaker_1: people exactly like either i feel like i'm talking too much about korea and they're like oh shut up or and it's hard to want your best to hell yeah i want someone to be able to appreciate or just to even listen yeah you've been somewhere and you want to be able to share what you've seen and what you've learned
[08:20.75 - 08:23.19] speaker_0: so we're like grandmas we want to just tell our stories
[08:24.31 - 08:27.55] speaker_1: so it's really helped having toto around yeah and being able and
[08:27.63 - 08:28.43] speaker_0: i think there's something
[08:28.59 - 08:32.39] speaker_1: connect with him stronger just because we've been everywhere together yeah you guys
[08:32.39 - 09:00.51] speaker_0: have like a closer bond because you've been through a lot right right and i think there's something oh what was i going to say there's something cool about oh you guys a relationship too that we haven't mentioned yet that part of that reverse culture shock that we'll talk about in just a second is like a language thing going from not being in english in an english speaking country to being in the u s where there's english everywhere but you speak spanish so can you tell us a little bit about like your language experience with him i think this is okay
[09:00.67 - 09:32.91] speaker_1: for sure well before i was going to argentina because i wanted to learn spanish yeah and i met tao and we well when we met we didn't speak spanish immediately together we spoke english he speaks as he also speaks perfect english but then as time grew on i was getting more like i really want to learn spanish and like let's speak spanish together and which is actually really hard especially with a couple with a pair to be like okay we're going to speak only and change
[09:33.03 - 09:34.95] speaker_0: languages in the middle of your relationship
[09:35.27 - 09:53.15] speaker_1: yeah but we somehow managed to do that somewhat successfully i would say we speak spanish almost i would say ninety percent of the time that's awesome which is really good it's helped me a lot it's helped our relationship i don't know why but
[09:53.43 - 09:59.95] speaker_0: i mean that's part of his native language though so maybe for him too like he can connect better i
[10:00.19 - 10:04.67] speaker_1: i agree i think it has to do something like that all around it's been great so yeah
[10:05.35 - 10:14.19] speaker_0: yeah and it's really cool that like you have that connection but like coming back to the u s if you didn't want to speak english you could speak spanish
[10:14.23 - 10:34.87] speaker_1: together oh yeah i didn't mention that so when we came back to the u s and i felt like everyone's listening to my conversations and it was just uncomfortable i didn't want to speak out loud because i thought everyone's listening to me yeah and so we would speak spanish everywhere but then again also there's a lot of people who speak spanish so it doesn't work all the time but you know
[10:35.27 - 10:35.75] speaker_0: an illusion
[10:35.95 - 10:37.91] speaker_1: feel like you're speaking a secret language
[10:38.03 - 10:51.63] speaker_0: yeah and i think that's a good kind of segue to the next thing of like when have you experienced reverse culture shock so like coming back from the argentina korea experience do you experience any of that
[10:52.63 - 11:16.55] speaker_1: definitely i felt a kind of like a longing for the argentine lifestyle i had when i was in korea for at least a few months oh we can just go out to all these restaurants and they have a lot more varieties of food so that was hard um maybe public transportation although korea also has a fantastic public transportation it just it stops at at certain times you have to know
[11:17.59 - 11:19.23] speaker_0: argentinian transportation went on
[11:19.47 - 11:30.43] speaker_1: all night all day twenty four seven whoa you don't have to think okay i got to go home now but so there were some things that i missed about argentine life ahh
[11:30.87 - 11:32.71] speaker_0: that weren't in korea that
[11:32.95 - 11:42.59] speaker_1: yeah that didn't exist in korea and also at least in argentina i understood what people were saying and i could communicate even though it wasn't my first language at least i could communicate with people
[11:42.67 - 11:47.03] speaker_0: that makes a huge difference though like connecting with the culture right if you can understand the language
[11:47.51 - 12:09.83] speaker_1: i know it and it opened a lot of doors so when i went to korea i felt very like closed i couldn't communicate with anyone i didn't really know what was going on there was a lot of cultural differences too but eventually you know you adapt quick you adapt to any any circumstance right so i was able to adapt to living in korean
[12:10.39 - 12:13.11] speaker_0: you learn some of the language like enough to read
[12:13.23 - 12:15.15] speaker_1: or i could read minimally
[12:16.31 - 12:16.51] speaker_0: yes
[12:16.71 - 12:36.39] speaker_1: communicate with the students communicate with my co workers who sometimes some of them spoke english but anyway so when i went from korea to the u s there was like another level of culture shock just because america was my home country and then all of a sudden i felt like a foreigner in my own country
[12:36.59 - 12:37.95] speaker_0: that's like a really weird feeling
[12:38.03 - 12:43.35] speaker_1: and i almost i still feel that way to an extent not as strongly as when i first arrived and
[12:43.43 - 12:46.19] speaker_0: how long have you been back now sorry um
[12:47.11 - 12:50.23] speaker_1: i think it's been four months four months
[12:50.35 - 12:51.63] speaker_0: that's not long because
[12:51.71 - 12:54.27] speaker_1: i came in march of two thousand and sixteen
[12:54.35 - 12:57.75] speaker_0: so yeah market should be for my june yeah about four months mm
[12:58.11 - 12:59.31] speaker_1: so it's still very
[12:59.39 - 12:59.43] speaker_0: s
[12:59.87 - 13:03.71] speaker_1: yeah it's still fresh but it was definitely hard the first month yeah
[13:04.03 - 13:08.35] speaker_0: so what did you experience like tell us about that first month if you don't mind rehashing the sure
[13:08.43 - 13:44.35] speaker_1: i'm trying to think of some very good examples for well when i first arrived i arrived in what jackson hartfield airport okay which is in atlanta which is the one of the biggest airports and i just remember arriving there and all of a sudden hearing everyone speaking english and just like the interaction between the workers in the airport and the interactions with them with like me and tad and it just felt so strange it's like i don't know how to explain it that's the thing about reverse culture so it's really
[13:44.39 - 13:44.79] speaker_0: extreme
[13:45.35 - 14:02.07] speaker_1: unless you've experienced it and maybe you can prepare for it but some other examples um i remember going to get a cell phone in the u s and that just i i wasn't prepared for so much social interaction
[14:03.07 - 14:04.51] speaker_0: in english or in english
[14:04.59 - 14:17.51] speaker_1: i think that's what it was just like there's so many people and i kept feeling like people were listening to me or like watching me strangely because in korea people would look at me at least at least not that there's a foreigner because you're not korean
[14:17.91 - 14:18.07] speaker_0: right
[14:18.19 - 14:33.79] speaker_1: and so i i guess i assumed that people are still doing that although now i'm not standing out as a foreigner yeah but i still felt like these eyes were watching me and i felt really it just was a strange moment of life yeah i mean
[14:33.79 - 14:34.27] speaker_0: you guys like
[14:34.83 - 14:35.03] speaker_1: you do
[14:35.51 - 14:36.67] speaker_0: look like other people
[14:36.71 - 14:39.63] speaker_1: at you and i realize i'm not actually standing out like i was in
[14:39.75 - 15:23.99] speaker_0: korea not special anymore so like even though that's something negative i think reverse culture shock in general is something negative like you for me it's like nitpicking small things about american culture because that's like our home culture that i didn't nitpick about before like a big thing that got me i don't know why this was a big deal but for some reason when i came back from france living in france for a year for some reason it really bothered me that people mowed their lawns like when i saw people mowing their lawns like it's such a waste like why don't you just grow something else or why don't we have something else here like why are you mowing a lawn or why are you using a hundred grocery bags like just bring your own bag don't use these plastic bags and
[15:24.15 - 15:25.23] speaker_1: i don't understand it either yeah
[15:25.35 - 15:45.75] speaker_0: if it's like such small thing that shouldn't bother me and i feel like i'm a pretty generally like easy going or like little things don't bother me like that but i think it was a reverse culture shock that like comparing it to good things from the culture that i came from and being like why is my culture like this oh i'm like so pissed off about it right
[15:45.75 - 16:30.19] speaker_1: and you realize well i don't know that maybe it's better to bring your own bag bring a little cart like yeah and it just isn't part of the american culture at this point another thing about grocery stores there are so many options i realize this is why we have a problem with obesity maybe i mean it could be the fact that you have a hundred different types of cereal to choose from or i don't know how many types of cereal there are too many like and then just i want to buy um milk mm why do i have to choose from twenty different types of milk why are there why are there so many options there shouldn't it's overwhelming
[16:30.19 - 16:40.55] speaker_0: i just like today we went to the store to look at coconut oil and there was it's a small grocery store and there is what like m thirty choices twenty choices like americans
[16:40.63 - 16:41.79] speaker_1: have a lot of options
[16:42.47 - 16:42.75] speaker_0: a lot
[16:42.79 - 16:45.75] speaker_1: of co don't have that many options to choose from
[16:45.91 - 17:05.79] speaker_0: yeah i mean it's in a way it's neither here nor there but it's one of those things that when you come back to your own culture and see that you can feel overwhelmed and i think that's like a sign of reverse culture shock is that being overwhelmed by something that you thought would be normal like going to the grocery something really normal
[17:05.95 - 17:16.11] speaker_1: something you do all the time and all of a sudden it's something that is a small struggle yeah yeah saying what you want to eat and you know yeah
[17:16.47 - 17:35.63] speaker_0: do you think that reverse culture shock is like avoidable is it possible to make it any better than hm it is and this could apply to culture shock too but like we already said i think we kind of prepare for culture shock when you go to a foreign country you prepare more right so like reverse culture shock
[17:35.95 - 18:09.31] speaker_1: pre i'm going back to my home yeah i think there are certain things you can do to prepare for it i don't think you can completely avoid it but at least know that these things are going to be issues for me so what's what can i do to ease the difficulty for example public transportation in korea is fantastic i never drove a car i biked i took the bus so i took the subway so i thought for me it's going to be very important to live somewhere and to be able to either walk bike or drive a car minimally
[18:09.47 - 18:10.99] speaker_0: yeah that sounds a lot like me you have
[18:11.15 - 18:14.83] speaker_1: a car you have to get a car if you're in the u s it's unavoidable
[18:14.91 - 18:19.55] speaker_0: unless you live like downtown new york but that's not going to be many people right
[18:19.79 - 18:19.87] speaker_1: so
[18:20.11 - 18:21.71] speaker_0: i thought unless you're a millionaire
[18:22.95 - 18:36.71] speaker_1: i need to realize that this is going to be a problem for me and prepare for as best i can although i'm still going to have to drive and i'm still going to have to kind of face this m difficulty you could say yeah
[18:37.07 - 18:39.27] speaker_0: you're still going to have to do something you don't want to do
[18:39.95 - 18:48.47] speaker_1: right i'm not comfortable or used to doing yeah but it is the only way i i guess you can prepare for it but you can't avoid it
[18:48.67 - 19:24.87] speaker_0: yeah i think like for me coming back to the u s i had a lot of fears i don't know if they were irrational or not but like i knew that i had a great time living abroad and in france and in europe and in korea and it was just so fun and really enjoyable and every day there's something different and new and then coming back to the u s a a big thing was is every day just going to be like a daily routine am i just going to feel like there's not new surprises around every corner you know when you're you're abroad even if you're just traveling and visiting you you find a new market around the corner or there's someone playing street music or it's like a little thing
[19:26.23 - 19:26.27] speaker_1: like
[19:26.43 - 19:46.99] speaker_0: that was a big deal for us is like finding somewhere where there is new stuff going on or like there's maybe some diversity or some new cultures or something more than just a box lifestyle where you have got like franchises and suburban lifestyle m cities
[19:47.75 - 20:01.87] speaker_1: right i think that would be very difficult to go from living in korea to going and living in suburbia you know you have to drive twenty minutes just to go to the supermarket and there's nothing really going around and around where you're living that would be really hard yeah
[20:02.19 - 20:06.91] speaker_0: so i think that's something that was a party for us it seems like for you guys to right list as to the city
[20:07.55 - 20:18.43] speaker_1: i think i realized i like living in bigger cities you it's going to be really difficult to go and live in the countryside or li in a little neighborhood yeah really far away from everything
[20:19.11 - 20:26.23] speaker_0: and maybe you know that's something that could happen in the future i don't know i i would like to have a garden or i like to live
[20:26.59 - 20:26.91] speaker_1: mhm
[20:27.35 - 20:36.47] speaker_0: it's maybe more idealistic but at the moment it's not really something that i want so maybe in the future but i think that's an important point like knowing what you want right
[20:36.55 - 20:47.47] speaker_1: everyone wants something different something they have their own what's important to you is different from what's important to you and somebody else and know what you want and and
[20:47.63 - 21:19.71] speaker_0: taking some time to analyze that like oh i what do i like about living where i'm living now like in korea you really like transportation so how can i make that happen in my home country or like for me i like having little surprises around every corner and it's not going to be the exactly the same like it's not a foreign country but how can i make that happen so or find the right place and at least for americans i don't know maybe it's different for other countries but for us it's not a big deal if you don't go back and live in your home town
[21:21.07 - 21:21.79] speaker_1: we can live
[21:21.91 - 21:22.35] speaker_0: anywhere
[21:24.19 - 21:24.63] speaker_1: as i know
[21:24.71 - 21:54.91] speaker_0: some people at least some people i've talked to who aren't american they're really surprised that you know maybe you've lived in california like dan who is my husband maybe some of you have met him like dan lived in california then colorado then pennsylvania then he went to school in tennessee that's all over the u s like east west middle so everywhere and it's totally normal like most people have lived in several places and even for us we lived in the north and then in the south mm and we have like roots in both places
[21:55.87 - 22:01.91] speaker_1: so i feel like it's hard to come back and feel super connected immediately yeah that's not going to happen yeah
[22:02.11 - 22:14.59] speaker_0: but that's okay i think like knowing about it that's probably the biggest thing to avoid it is like being knowledgeable that you might feel shocked about it mm and how to kind of avoid that or just have more patience with yourself
[22:15.51 - 22:19.83] speaker_1: wait you know it's going to get better you'll feel more connected and integrated yeah as time goes
[22:19.95 - 22:38.15] speaker_0: or be more a patient with your partner like if i was like mad at or like upset at damn about something i'd be like wait this is probably just because i'm adjusting i shouldn't get like frustrated or sniffy about little things because i'm i'm adjusting so sorry to put this on you you know
[22:39.07 - 22:40.19] speaker_1: at least you realize that
